    <p class="text">In the context of mathematics, "dwarf" and "not dwarf" are terms used to classify numbers based on certain properties related to their divisors. A number is called a "dwarf" if the sum of its proper divisors (excluding the number itself) is less than the number itself. In other words, if the sum of all the positive divisors of a number, excluding the number itself, is smaller than the number, then the number is considered a dwarf. </p>
    
    <p class="text">On the other hand, a number is called "not dwarf" if the sum of its proper divisors is equal to or greater than the number itself. If the sum of all the positive divisors of a number, excluding the number itself, is equal to or larger than the number, then the number is classified as "not dwarf." For example, let's consider the number 12. The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The sum of its proper divisors (excluding 12) is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16. Since 16 is greater than 12, the number 12 is considered "not dwarf." </p>
    
    <p class="text">On the other hand, let's take the number 8. The divisors of 8 are 1, 2, 4, and 8. The sum of its proper divisors (excluding 8) is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. Since 7 is less than 8, the number 8 is classified as a "dwarf." </p>
        
    <p class="text">The concept of dwarf and not dwarf numbers provides a way to categorize numbers based on their divisor sums and can be an interesting area of study in number theory.</p>
